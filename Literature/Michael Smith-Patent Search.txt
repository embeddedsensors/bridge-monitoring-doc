Patent searching can be a very useful tool for determining if there has been any
prior investigation into a topic of interest.  It can also reveal if there is already
exisiting technology in the area of focus and what aspects have been completed and what have not.  
By using the USPC search database, information regarding possible "acoustic reflectometers" can be obtained.
Possible search terms can be and are not limited to:
1.Sound
2.Bridges
3.Acoustics
4.Suspension Bridges
5.Reflectometer
6. Acoustic Emission
7. Main Cables
8. Structural Health Monitoring
9. Structural Acoustics

The database is incredibly immense.  It becomes useful to search predefined indexies to narrow the list to
relevant subqueries only.  Using this method, the following sub categories were marked for relevance:

SOUND
sub category: sound meter : 73

Class 73: measuring and testing
   sub-cateegories:
	73-587--Acoustic Emission
	73-596--Beamed
	73-627--By relfected wave
	73-783--Deformation or change in stress after fracture, cutting, or boring
	73-801--Acoustic Emission
